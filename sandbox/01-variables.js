 * We assign information to variables,

 * To create a variable, use the `const` keyword:

// This is also a comment, but just for a single line
// To reference a variable later, just use its name:

console.log('My favorite color is', favoriteColor)

// There is another way to create a variable: 

let myAge = 31

console.log('This is how old I am: ', myAge)

// Since I created `myAge` with `let`, I can re-assign it later

myAge = 32

console.log('This is how old I am now: ', myAge)

/** 
 * If `myAge` were created with `const`, it would generate an error and
 * this program would fail
 */

/**
 * Exercise:
 * 
 * Create a `const` variable called 'myName' that is assigned the value of your name.
 * Next, print that variable using `console.log`
 * 
 * Finally, re-assign the `myAge` variable to equal your age, then print it.
