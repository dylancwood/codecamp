2017 STEAM CodeCamp Prineville, OR
====

## Basic outline:
1. Install Node.js and Visual Studio Code on all computers
2. Put this repository on the desktop of each computer, and `npm install` johnny-five
3. On day 1, go through all exercises in the sandbox
4. On subsequent days, go through the exercises provided by nodebots-workshop:
  * The exercises include instructions a some hints, and are automatically tested
  * Once a passing solution is found, the program can be uploaded to an Arduino and run there
5. On the last two days, students can take what they have learned and do something custom with an Arduino


## Todo:
 Go through nodebots workshop completely
 Devise 1-day intro to javascript


## Nodejs install on windows:
1. https://nodejs.org/en/download/: Choose ‘Windows Installer’ and follow prompts
2. Open powershell (start, search for powershell)

## Visual Studio Code install on windows:
1. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Follow prompts, select ‘add as editor for supported file types’
3. Install code-runner extension:
  1. Ctrl + P
  2. ‘ext install code-runner’
  3. Click ‘install’
  4. Click ‘reload’

## Install nodebots tutorial (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodebot-workshop)
1. Open powershell (start, search for powershell)
2. Execute `npm install -g nodebot-workshop`

## Restart afterwards

## Intro:
### Tools:
* *Javascript*: programming language used by all websites.
* *Node.js*: Javascript _runner_ (runtime environment) for outside of a browser (e.g. on your desktop or on a server).
* *Visual Studio Code*: Text editor with auto completion and highlighting to improve code readability.
With the code-runner extension, it can also run javascript code directly, so that we can see the results of our changes. We can also use the terminal feature to interact with the nodebots tutorials.

## Notes from intro with Angela and Brent:
* Missing cool introduction file
* Introduce self
* Describe screen (file explorer, text editor, console output)
* Explain console.log: logs to console
* Variables are case sensitive!
* Cover comments in first file.
* Call nodejsrules() in functions file
* Encourage re-running the file and correlating console output to each line
* Step through with debugger
* Explain 'call', 'execute', etc...
